A JavaScript generator is a special type of function in JavaScript that allows you to pause its
execution and later resume it. Unlike regular functions that run to completion and return a single
value, generators enable you to produce a sequence of values over time.

Generators are defined using a function with an asterisk (`*`) after the `function` keyword. Within
a generator function, you use the `yield` keyword to produce a value and pause the generator's
execution. The generator can then be resumed to continue its execution.

Here's a simple example of a generator function:

```js
function* myGenerator() {
  yield 1
  yield 2
  yield 3
}

const generator = myGenerator()

console.log(generator.next()) // { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(generator.next()) // { value: 2, done: false }
console.log(generator.next()) // { value: 3, done: false }
console.log(generator.next()) // { value: undefined, done: true }
```

In this example, the `myGenerator` function yields three values (1, 2, and 3) using the `yield`
keyword. The `generator.next()` method is called to retrieve the next value in the sequence, and it
returns an object with a `value` property representing the yielded value and a done property
indicating whether the generator has finished.

Generators are particularly useful for asynchronous programming, allowing you to write asynchronous
code in a more synchronous style. They can be used with asynchronous operations to simplify complex
asynchronous code and make it more readable. The `async/await` syntax, introduced in ECMAScript
2017, is often used in conjunction with generators for asynchronous programming in modern
JavaScript.
