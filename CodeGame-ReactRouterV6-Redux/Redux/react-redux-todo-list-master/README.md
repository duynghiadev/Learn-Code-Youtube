# React Redux To-Do List

A React to-do list app with Redux(and Redux Thunk), Bootstrap 4, additional plugins, and a Webpack 4 config that extracts Sass and assets into the dist folder. Webpack 4 introduced a cascade of breaking changes in my prior workflow and thought this might be useful.

*The API object in src/utils/app.js is there to sample a possible api.*
