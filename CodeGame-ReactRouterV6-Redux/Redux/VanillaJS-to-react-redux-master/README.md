## What about it?

It is a simple demo project where it has implemented in four different ways aiming to show the difference among them. It will help new developers who just step into redux-react stack to understand the flow of redux and how it is related with react. I have implement same project in following approaches:

 1. Vanilla JS (Pure JS).
 2. Redux in Pure JS 
 3. React
 4. and finally React-redux 

## Demo

Final version that has been developed with react-redux can be checked here https://samirkumardas.github.io/VanillaJS-to-react-redux/

## How to run?

cd vanilla

npm install

npm start

Project will be run on 9900 port so it will be accessible through the URL http://localhost:9900

## To run another project, change project directory

cd react_redux

npm install

npm start

To kill existing running server on port 9900, you can run following command. 

`kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:9900)`
