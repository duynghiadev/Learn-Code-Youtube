## Brief Introduction

As a second-year student majoring in Software Engineering at [FPT University Danang](https://dnuni.fpt.edu.vn/), I am currently eager and motivated to find part-time jobs that can fit my academic schedule while also providing opportunities to enhance my programming skills. I am confident that I have the knowledge and skills required to take on such jobs and I am excited about the prospect of contributing to a company while gaining valuable experience in the field.

}
```

## Certificates

- **1st Rank in Mathematics Competition**: A highly competitive and challenging event that tests participants' problem-solving skills and mathematical knowledge through a series of rigorous exams.
- **IELTS Overall 7.0**: A standardized test designed to measure the English language proficiency of non-native speakers for academic purposes.

> **NOTE** I am optimistic about obtaining further programming awards in the future lmao.

## Technologies

- **[NestJs](https://nestjs.com/)**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and reliable server-side applications.
- **[ReactJs](https://react.dev/)**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces that are declarative, efficient, and easy to maintain.
- **[Angular](https://angular.io/)**: A comprehensive TypeScript-based framework for building dynamic web applications with a powerful set of features for building complex, scalable, and performant front-end applications.
