# Vanilla JavaScript Ecommerce

Vanilla JavaScript Ecommerce is a project I developed with Vanilla JavaScript to improve my JavaScript skills. It is created by taking mobile-first design into consideration. BEM methodology is used as the CSS naming method. SCSS/SASS is used as the CSS-preprocessor.
