## Overview

The **NestJS Starter Repo** Repository is a **boilerplate codebase** for building scalable, modular, and maintainable server-side applications using the NestJS framework. It provides a robust starting point for developers to create new projects with pre-configured settings, best practices, and popular libraries.

## Getting Started

To use the NestJS Starter Repository, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download and install them from [the official website](https://nodejs.org/) â†—.

Once you have installed Node.js and npm, you can clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/CodieGlot/nestjs-starter-repo.git
```

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
$ npm install
```

> **NOTE** The original repository can be accessed/viewed **[here](https://github.com/CodieGlot/nestjs-starter-repo)**.

## Project structure

The NestJS Starter Repository **project structure** is designed to promote modularity, maintainability, and scalability. Here is an overview of the main directories and files:

- **src/app**: This directory contains the main application module, controller, and service files. The modules directory is where you can create different modules for your application.
- **src/shared/config**: This directory contains configuration files for the application. You can modify the .env file to set up your database connection.
- **src/common**: This directory contains shared code that can be utilized across the application, such as constants, decorators, DTOs, enums, and filters.
- **src/main.ts**: This file is the entry point for the application and starts the NestJS application.
- **src/utils.ts**: This file contains utility functions used throughout the application.
- **test/**: This directory contains the end-to-end (e2e) testing files and **Jest configuration** file.

> **NOTE** For more information, check out the src/ directory.

## Features

The NestJS Starter Repository comes with several pre-configured features that can help you get started quickly. Here are some of the features:

- **Swagger UI**: A pre-configured **Swagger UI** is included to provide an easy way to visualize and interact with your API's resources.
- **Jest Testing**: Jest is a popular testing framework that is used for **unit testing**, **integration testing**, and end-to-end testing. It provides an easy and flexible way to test your application.
- **Environment Variables**: The application is configured to use **environment variables** to provide flexibility and security.
- **Custom Decorators**: The application includes several **custom decorators** to simplify common tasks such as validating input and handling errors.
- **Migration**: A powerful feature in TypeORM. Migrations allow developers to easily manage changes to the database schema over the course of the application's development, without losing data or disrupting the application's functionality.
- **JWT Authentication**: A popular approach to securing server-side applications. It involves the use of a token-based system, where a user's credentials are authenticated and a token is generated. This token is then used to authenticate subsequent requests to the server.

> **NOTE** These features are subject to expansion in the near future, so stay tuned for additional updates.
