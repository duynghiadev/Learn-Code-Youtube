# Introduction

The Todo App is a **decentralized application (dApp)** that allows users to create and manage their to-do lists on the Solana blockchain.

## Installation

Clone the Todo App repository from the Github repository using the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/CodieGlot/solana-todo-app.git
```

> **NOTE** **[Github](https://github.com/CodieGlot/solana-todo-app)** code.

## Usage

The Todo App built on Solana blockchain with a React frontend is a dApp that allows users to create and manage their to-do lists on the Solana blockchain. The app is built using Solana's Web3.js library for interacting with the blockchain and React for the frontend.

Here are some of the key features of the Programmer Landing Page:

- **Decentralized** - The Todo App is built on the Solana blockchain, which means that data is stored on a decentralized network of nodes instead of a centralized server.
- **Secure** - The app uses Solana's high-performance blockchain protocol to ensure that data is secure and tamper-proof.
- **Transparent** - The app allows users to view the entire history of their to-do list, including past revisions and updates.
- **Immutable** - Once a to-do item is added to the blockchain, it cannot be deleted or modified.

To use the Todo App, simply access the web application from your browser. The app comes with pre-built components for creating and managing to-do items.

To customize the frontend, you can modify the source code files in the src directory. The App.js file is the main component that renders the Todo App, and you can add or modify components as needed.

> **NOTE** Consider exploring **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** as an option for deploying your project.

## Deployment

To deploy the Solana Todo App, you can use any web hosting service that supports static website hosting. You can build the landing page for production using the following command:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

> **NOTE** My **[deployment](https://todo-app-solana-gorl.vercel.app/)**.

This will create a production-ready version of the landing page in the build directory. You can then upload the contents of the build directory to your web hosting service.

## Conclusion

The Todo App built on Solana blockchain with a React frontend provides a powerful and secure way to create and manage to-do lists on the blockchain. With its pre-built components and **dynamic content**, you can create a to-do app that is both engaging and functional.
