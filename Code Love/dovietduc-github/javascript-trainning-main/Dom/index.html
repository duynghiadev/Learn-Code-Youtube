              <b>React</b> makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your
              application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes

              <b>Vue</b> (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It
              builds on top of standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and provides a declarative and component-based
              programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be it simple or complex.

              <b>Angular</b> is a development platform, built on TypeScrip With Angular, you're taking advantage of a
              platform that can scale from single-developer projects to enterprise-level applications. Angular is
              designed to make updating as straightforward as possible, so take advantage of the latest developments
              with a minimum of effort. Best of all, the Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7
              million developers, library authors, and content creators

              <b>Svelte</b> is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like
              React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that
              happens when you build your app
