# TinyCode6: MicroTask vs MicroTask in Asynchronous JavaScript

In this video I talk about asynchronous code in JavaScript wherein the microtask and macrotask differ from each other.

Here are some introduction obtained from MDN:

The awaited expression is performed when an await is found in code (either in an async function or in a module), and all other code that depends on the value of the expression is halted and queued up for execution later.The primary thread is subsequently released for the subsequent event loop activity.
