          <b>Vue</b> (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It builds on
          top of standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and provides a declarative and component-based programming model

          to make updating as straightforward as possible, so take advantage of the latest developments with a minimum
          of effort. Best of all, the Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 million developers,
