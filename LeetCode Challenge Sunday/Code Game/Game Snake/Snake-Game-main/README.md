# Snake-Game
Snake-Game is a classic game of snake, created in web form and inspired by the old mobile games. The game is built using a combination of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

# Main Technologies Used
- JavaScript:
The game logic and functionality is mainly implemented in JavaScript. This includes the movement of the snake, collision detection, and scoring mechanism.

- HTML and CSS:
The game is built with HTML and CSS, which provide the structure and styling of the web form.

- Bootstrap:
It has been used in this project to help make the game more accessible on different screen sizes.
 
 # Top 3 table
The game features a top 3 table, which displays the highest scores achieved by players.
Firebase Firestore is a NoSQL cloud-based database that has been used to store and manage player scores. The scores are updated in real-time, allowing players to see their rank and compete against others for the top score.

By using these technologies and tools, Snake-Game is able to provide an enjoyable and engaging gaming experience for players. The real-time scoring mechanism and top 3 table also add an element of competition and motivation for players to achieve the highest score.
